  <h2>The Journey</h2>

  <p>
    I've spent the last 20 years at the intersection of code and
    leadership—building systems, building teams, and occasionally building
    companies.
  </p>

  <h3>Where It Started</h3>

  <p>
    I began as a full-stack engineer, writing code and solving problems. For
    nearly a decade, I honed my craft across the entire stack, from databases to
    frontend, always driven by curiosity and a love for building things that
    work.
  </p>

  <p>
    My academic background in Computer Science gave me the foundation, but it
    was the daily grind of shipping features, debugging production issues, and
    learning new frameworks that really shaped me as an engineer.
  </p>

  <h3>The Founder Chapter</h3>

  <p>
    In my late twenties, I took the leap and co-founded a startup as the
    technical co-founder and CTO. Just me and the CEO, building an ML-powered
    computer vision platform for the hospitality industry. I architected the
    entire system, made every technical decision, and learned what it really
    means to build something from absolute zero.
  </p>

  <p>
    COVID killed the company, but the experience was invaluable. I learned how
    to make technical decisions with limited resources, how to balance speed
    with quality, and most importantly, how to stay technical while thinking
    strategically about the business.
  </p>

  <h3>The Leadership Evolution</h3>

  <p>
    After the startup, I naturally gravitated toward engineering management. I
    realized that my favorite moments weren't just when I solved a tough
    technical problem—they were when I helped someone else solve theirs, or when
    I watched a team gel and start shipping amazing work.
  </p>

  <p>
    I joined Cylinder, a Series B HealthTech startup, and built an engineering
    team from scratch. Hired every single person. Doubled the team size.
    Launched an internship program. Promoted engineers. And most importantly,
    created a culture where people actually want to show up and do their best
    work.
  </p>

  <h3>What I Do Now</h3>

  <p>
    Today, I lead AI product development at Cylinder. I'm architecting
    HIPAA-compliant LLM features, integrating cutting-edge AI into our existing
    platform, and making sure our team stays ahead of the curve.
  </p>

  <p>
    But here's the thing: I never stopped coding. I still push code regularly. I
    still get excited about new frameworks. I still tinker with side projects on
    weekends.
  </p>

  <p>
    This combination—deep technical credibility plus the ability to build and
    lead teams—is what defines my approach to leadership.
  </p>

  <h2>What Makes Me Different</h2>

  <h3>I lead from the front.</h3>

  <p>
    I don't ask my team to do anything I wouldn't or couldn't do myself. My
    technical skills are sharp, and I use them to earn respect and make better
    decisions.
  </p>

  <h3>I give engineers autonomy.</h3>

  <p>
    Micromanagement kills creativity and ownership. I hire smart people, give
    them context and trust, and get out of their way. Then I support them when
    they need it.
  </p>

  <h3>I build culture intentionally.</h3>

  <p>
    High-performing teams don't happen by accident. I've established community
    of practice initiatives, regular knowledge sharing, and a culture of
    continuous learning.
  </p>

  <h3>I stay current.</h3>

  <p>
    The tech world moves fast. I experiment with LLM code assistants, follow
    emerging trends in AI/ML, and constantly sharpen my tools. I can't lead if
    I'm not learning.
  </p>
